 FW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are mighty warriors, but still are still too easily cut down by a [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] blade."
 FW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Your admirals could do with some training at our military academies. We can give you a discount."

 DU_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Are you really sentient?"
 
 HM_ARROGANT_GREETING_01:0 "Our Mind transcends all sentient life. You are nothing."
 HM_ARROGANT_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are just food. Not particularly tasty ones, but food nonetheless."

 MC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "At [Root.GetName], we want you to trust us with your money, because it's with your money that we can make you even more money. How? It's not funny business, it's money business."
 MC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Imagine planting a money tree on the ground and watering it. Hold on, imagine if you had a money pet and you fed it more money, and after digesting it...you know, just come in and talk to us. We have even more metaphors that allow us to avoid saying what we really do with your money. [Root.GetName], feed the money monster."

 AE_OPPOSING_GREETING_01:0 "Your false ideas and values must not be allowed to propagate in this galaxy!"
 AE_OPPOSING_GREETING_02:0 "Keep talking. No one believes you."

 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "Did... did you STEAL our technologies? When will the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] do something about their [GetScientistPlural]' theft of technology?"
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "Try not to blow yourselves up with Dark Matter Power. Scattered bits of [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] make an awful mess."
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_03:0 "Not sure how you stole Dark Matter Power, but stealing is not mature behaviour." 
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_04:0 "So you think us equals now? Allow us to demonstration the falsehood of this assumption."
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_05:0 "Your mastery of Dark Matter fails to make your communications any less irritating."
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_06:0 "Your technological advances far outpace the maturity of your civilization."
 BAD_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_07:0 "Nope, you're still making that raspy noise, like children learning to speak."

 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "We [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] often wonder what you will do next, now that you have unlocked the secrets of this universe." 
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "Does it also amuse the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to watch these other children play?"
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_03:0 "Your mastery over dark matter is impressive. We may have underestimated your capabilities."
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_04:0 "How did you advance so quickly? Was your civilization guided by an entity not of this galaxy, but from a different dimension?"
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_05:0 "Care to join [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] for a game of Stellaris?"
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_06:0 "Is this the zenith of your civilization before you blink out of existence? Time will tell."
 NEUTRAL_FE_TO_AE_GREETING_07:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] should really consider clothing befitting of their civilization's stature. Just a pointer."

 GOOD_DEFAULT_TO_AE_GREETING_06:0 "Your enigmatic technology is often confused for magic among the [Root.GetAdj] populace."
 GOOD_DEFAULT_TO_AE_GREETING_07:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] people hope to someday achieve a measure of your greatness."
 
 BAD_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "We demand compensation for the stolen Dark Matter technologies!"
 BAD_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "Your mastery of the forbidden technologies are nothing but a farce, a mask to hide your primitive nature."
 BAD_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_03:0 "You think a mastery of Dark Matter is enough to compare to a civilization that is millennia old?"
 BAD_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_04:0 "Once a primitive, always a primitive. We will gladly send you back to Stone Ages."
 
 NEUTRAL_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "Perhaps, the [From.GetName] have a role to play still."
 NEUTRAL_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "If you stay out of our way, we might stay out of yours."

 NEUTRAL_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_05:0 "Are you sure you're observing all safety protocols when handling Dark Matter Power?"
 NEUTRAL_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_06:0 "We will show you the grace and power of a civilization that has matured with age, not just technological advances."
 NEUTRAL_AFE_TO_AE_GREETING_07:0 "Why do our ships look so similar? This raises serious questions."
 
 FE_TO_LOST_01:0 "We see a lot of our past self in you."
 FE_TO_LOST_02:0 "How the mighty have fallen."
 FE_TO_LOST_03:0 "So you have accepted the truth, that the galaxy will evolve the way it was always destined to, regardless of our will."
 FE_TO_LOST_04:0 "Let it go. Let it all go."
 FE_TO_LOST_05:0 "Let the primitives fight amongst themselves while we watch."
 FE_TO_LOST_06:0 "The primitives will never listen...and that is why they are primitives. Trying to let them see a higher form of existence is ultimately, futile."
 FE_TO_LOST_07:0 "We've been there. Trust us, we know."
 
 HIVE_EMPIRE_TO_AE_GREETING_01:0 "Our mind finds it...difficult...to adjust to your rebirth."
 HIVE_EMPIRE_TO_AE_GREETING_02:0 "We just want to eat..."
 HIVE_EMPIRE_TO_AE_GREETING_03:0 "We are eating. Check back later."
 
 AE_TO_LOST_01:0 "We are glad you have seen sense that there can only be room for one of us in the galaxy."
 AE_TO_LOST_02:0 "Is that all you've got?"
 AE_TO_LOST_03:0 "So soon?"
 AE_TO_LOST_04:0 "Stay out and don't come back."
 
 LOST_TO_AE_01:0 "You don't know the power of [Root.GetName]."
 LOST_TO_AE_02:0 "Fools. The more wars you fight the more respect slips from your tentacles."
 LOST_TO_AE_03:0 "We will be back."
 LOST_TO_AE_04:0 "You haven't yet realised the truth that might doesn't make right. Your technologies are but a charade to who you really are."
 
 OE_GREETING_01:0 "It seems the galaxy is in need of our presence once more. Will you help us protect our galaxy?"
 OE_GREETING_02:0 "The times have changed, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Though some of those other precursor fools seem none the wiser."
 OE_GREETING_03:0 "The galaxy's lack of progress in our absence concerns us, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Had those decrepit Fallen Empires performed their duty, this crisis would never have happened."
 OE_GREETING_04:0 "Do you need help? Weapons to fight the crisis perhaps?"
 OE_GREETING_05:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] seem smart. Perhaps we could use your help later."
 OE_GREETING_06:0 "Are you here to help, or are you here to dawdle? Toughen up and return to the battlefield."
 OE_GREETING_07:0 "Those decrepit Fallen Empires are fools. They care about no one but themselves - even if the galaxy is at stake."
 OE_GREETING_08:0 "If only...we were in a better shape to defend the galaxy. We wish the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] warriors good fortune on the battlefield."
 OE_GREETING_09:0 "With great power comes great responsibility. What have those precursor empires done during this time?"
 OE_GREETING_10:0 "Unfortunately, our fleets are not in a state to aid you on the battlefield. But perhaps there are some tasks you can do for us."
 OE_GREETING_11:0 "Battles are soon upon us. Together we shall triumph."
 OE_GREETING_12:0 "Our fleets are currently under maintenance, but we will join you in battle as soon as we can. The galaxy is at stake!"
 OE_GREETING_13:0 "I cannot see we can gain anything from this conversation."
 OE_GREETING_14:0 "One day, perhaps you will learn to respect your betters, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
 OE_GREETING_15:0 "Begone [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], you have nothing we want."
 OE_GREETING_16:0 "Servants of Darkness shall not escape judgment, in this life or the next."
 
 AOE_GREETING_01:0 "Are you in need of our protection?"
 AOE_GREETING_02:0 "May we be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out."
 AOE_GREETING_03:0 "You may have our protection, but you may not use our technologies."
 AOE_GREETING_04:0 "Submit, or face the Imperial Armada."
 AOE_GREETING_05:0 "The [From.GetName] has defied us for the last time. The day of your judgment is near."
 AOE_GREETING_06:0 "Do you need something? The [Root.GetName] is not open to signing migration pacts with its subjects, for our people have no desire to move to primitive worlds."
 AOE_GREETING_07:0 "We know you adore the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] people, but [Root.Capital.GetName] is not open to foreign tourists right now."
 AOE_GREETING_08:0 "What can we do for you today, fellow [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]?"
 AOE_GREETING_09:0 "[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] is a wise leader. It would be good if we could meet in person some time."
 AOE_GREETING_10:0 "Have you discovered more of our history? Do you have any new findings to share?"
 AOE_GREETING_11:0 "[Root.Capital.GetName] will always be open to fellow [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] should your people ever want to visit."
 AOE_GREETING_12:0 "So... about the Golden City. When can we send a team?"
 AOE_GREETING_13:0 "YOU HAVE NOO POWER HERE...SERVANTS OF DARKNESS...YOU ARE NAMELESS...FACELESS...GO BACK TO THE SHADOWS...FROM...WHENCE...YOU...CAME...!!"
 
 
 OE_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "So, the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have chosen death!"
 OE_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetName] shall meet you on the battlefield at long last!"
 OE_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] dare stand against the might of the [Root.GetName]."
 OE_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "Our superior forces will always triumph over evil."
