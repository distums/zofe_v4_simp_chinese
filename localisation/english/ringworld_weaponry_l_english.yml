 ringworld_empire_digsite_1_desc:0 "Due to recent advances in powering technologies, we believe it is now possible to revive the mysterious databank in the Ancestor's Archives on §H[From.Planet.GetName]§!.\n\nNaturally, it will take some time for our team to assemble and all precautions be taken. Once reactivated, there is no telling what the databank could tell us of our past, as we continue our quest in search of our roots."

 ringworld_weaponry.101.desc:0 "It seems the secrets of our Ancestors beckon us forth.\n\nAfter all precautions are taken so we wouldn't accidentally blow up the databank and all the knowledge within, our team of [Owner.GetScientistPlural] began feeding it with small amounts of $tech_dark_matter_power_core$. A few hours later, the databank hummed to life once more and the initial interface became usable.\n\nIt will be time consuming to translate our Ancestor's ancient tongue, to ensure our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] won't press the wrong button. But our initial understanding is that this is some sort of historical archive with mentions of technologies we have never even heard of. One of such technologies that our Ancestors possessed was the §Y$tech_dark_energy_power_core$§!, and our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] are eager to investigate further."

 ringworld_weaponry.102.desc:0 "Extracting any kind of information from an ancient machine is always a delicate process, but more information has surfaced since about the various skirmishes that occurred during the initial stages of the Great Crusade, where our Ancestors’ fleets equipped with §Y$ tech_dark_energy_jump_drive$§! were often able to pick their battles, allowing them to use hit and run tactics against their Nemesis, causing great damage in the process.\n\nShould we be able to learn such technologies, it would enable our fleets to do the same to our enemies."

 ringworld_weaponry.103.desc:0 "As the Great Crusade takes its toll on both sides of the conflict, our ancestors realized that bigger and more powerful weapons were needed. New records revealed that the §Y$tech_dark_energy_power_booster$§! was one such attempts to bolster the power supplies during particularly intense battles, where the demands of weapon systems often hindered the fleets' ability to manoeuvre and retreat, leading to unnecessary losses.\n\nJust as the Ancestors adapted to the strengths of their Nemesis, so too has the Nemesis evolved to counter their tactics, and began striking at vital systems that our Ancestors cannot afford to lose, forcing them into pitched battle. Many worlds perished, and the atrocities committed under a certain §HBattle Group North§! of the Nemesis received significant mention, its reputation tarnished forever in our history."

 ringworld_weaponry.104.desc:0 "Building on a string of victories, §HBattle Group North§! of the Nemesis led by §YAdmiral Armageddon§! eventually forced their way through our Ancestors' defences and arrived in the system of §H[From.Solar_System.GetName]§!.  Awaiting them were sixty of the Ancestor's most advanced battlecruisers armed with the latest §Y$tech_massive_autocannons$§!, alongside a newly constructed ship of massive proportions.\n\nWithin days the battle was over. The flagship Titan of the §HBattle Group North§! was captured and refitted, §YAdmiral Armageddon§! slain, and the immediate threat to the empire had been annihilated, thus scoring one of the greatest victories for the grand coalition. Galvanized by this victory, perhaps emboldened or opportunistic, other nations rose up against a weakened Nemesis.\n\nIt would be many years before the Nemesis' fleets would return to the space of our Ancestors once again, and this time, with perhaps the greatest concentration of naval power the galaxy had ever seen."

 ringworld_weaponry.105.desc:0 "After suffering a crushing defeat at the system of §H[From.Solar_System.GetName]§!, the Nemesis took their time and plotted their revenge against our Ancestors, who now raided Nemesis territory, destroying many garrison stations and fleets in the process.\n\nBut the gathering storm could not be stopped. §HBattle Group South§!, §HBattle Group West§!, and §HBattle Group East§! of the Nemesis gathered in what was perhaps the greatest concentration of naval power the galaxy had ever seen, and their objective - to crush the Ancestors once and for all. Even with our Ancestor's new §Y$tech_dark_energy_shield$§!, the sheer firepower of the Nemesis' fleets is unmatched, and the resulting casualties for the Ancestors were astronomical. Even as the Nemesis fleets returned to the §H[From.Solar_System.GetName]§! once more, mercilessly bombing §H[From.Planet.GetName]§! into submission, the Ancestors held onto hope that their cries for help would be heard by other empires, and a relief force, or a counterattack from the grand coalition would eventually lift the siege.\n\nNo such help came, and our Ancestors would not surrender, so the Nemesis bombed our worlds until there appeared nothing left."

 ringworld_weaponry.106.desc:0 "Perhaps due to over-excitement, [event_target:silly_scientist.GetName] got involved with typing queries regarding the weapons and battle tactics used in the Great Crusade in our Ancestor's Databank. This led to a catastrophic malfunction of the ancient machine which believed the invaders had landed on the segment, triggering a sequence to self-destruct in order to protect our ancestors’ secrets.\n\nBefore the databank's final destruction, we were able to hack a portion of its entries regarding our ancestor's battle tactics, which gave us greater insights into the battles fought during that period.\n\nNaturally, due to this catastrophic accident that resulted in the forever loss of a part of our history, [event_target:silly_scientist.GetName] will be removed from their roles and punished accordingly."
 ringworld_weaponry.106.a:0 "Stupid [Owner.GetScientist]. But if the Nemesis returns once more, we will be ready!"
