 scfe_site_biggest_show_of_world_desc: "Our venture into the cosmos has unexpectedly borne fruit!\nWhen one of our unmanned probes began to malfunction, the expedition team directed it to make an emergency landing on a moon orbiting a gas giant, hoping to salvage it. To our astonishment, the probe touched down amidst the remnants of an ancient civilization.\nTime has eroded the memory of this society, yet it left behind an eloquent testimony to its existence: quaint towns, orderly suburbs, a well-furnished societal framework, and serene natural landscapes, mostly preserved. The planet may be modest in size, but it possesses all the essentials for a thriving community. Our scans reveal an eerie stillness, however, with no life forms detected.\nIt is imperative that we dedicate additional time to explore these ruins further."
 scfe_biggest_show.1.name: "Automaton"
 scfe_biggest_show.1.desc: "Since the inaugural landing, our research team has delved into the heart of a diminutive city nestled among the ruins, which appears to have been the nerve center of the planet. Our preliminary investigations have unearthed two pivotal revelations.\nFirstly, isolation is an illusion here. The planet teems with countless figures resembling dolls, eerily mimicking life forms—likely the architects of this world. Adorned in various attires, they seem designed for assorted tasks, suggesting a substitute for a once-thriving populace. Now, they lie in a dormant state, a silent army awaiting activation.\nSecondly, the planet is astonishingly well-preserved. Despite the cessation of most facilities from energy depletion, a core maintenance system hums in the background, dutifully performing its role. Our next objective is clear: we must unearth the control hub to unravel this enigma."
 scfe_biggest_show.2.name: "Show of Puppets"
 scfe_biggest_show.2.desc: "In their meticulous examination of the dolls, our researchers encountered a perplexing anomaly. Against their initial suppositions, approximately 30% of the dolls bore the likeness of children, and 20% mirrored the elderly - an oddity, considering the impracticality of such forms for laborious tasks.\nEvery dwelling was inhabited exclusively by these dolls, devoid of any signs of conventional life. Even more baffling was their arrangement, meticulously placed to mimic familial units. Furthermore, the presence of factories, educational institutions, and cultural centers, all staffed by these silent sentinels, deepens the mystery. Who would engineer such an elaborate simulacrum solely for dolls?\nWe now stand at the threshold of greater mysteries than we had ever anticipated."
 scfe_biggest_show.3.name: "Awakening"
 scfe_biggest_show.3.desc: "In the midst of their investigations, our expedition team chanced upon a dormant energy node, a potential source of power for the planet's control systems. After a thoughtful debate, the decision was made to infuse the node with energy. The moment the system was energized, a cacophony of piercing sounds filled the air.\nIt appears that this action simultaneously roused the dolls from their slumber. Their voices, indecipherable as of yet, seemed to carry the warmth of a greeting, though it was directed towards an unknown entity rather than our crew. Intriguingly, all the dolls seemed to be invoking the same figure, who is evidently not among our team.\nWhile direct communication with the dolls remains elusive, it's clear they share a unified purpose. We recommend further investigation to uncover the nature of their collective endeavor."
 scfe_biggest_show.4.name: "Show of Life"
 scfe_biggest_show.4.desc: "At last, the control center was unveiled, ingeniously concealed within the planet's dense clouds. Our system analysis shed light on the planet's true purpose.\nIt transpires that this planet was a stage for a production of extraordinary scale - a show where the lead was a living person unaware of their starring role. The infrastructure of the planet meticulously mimicked the ordinary life of their civilization for the spectacle. Hidden away, we uncovered a trove of recordings, chronicling a saga spanning generations, an epic that unfolded over millennia, crafted for the eyes of one.\nEach protagonist, emerging from an isolated hamlet, led a serene life, ultimately leaving the world in ignorance of their part in this elaborate masquerade. As epochs turned, the show's narrative evolved - from the early dramas filled with political intrigue, passionate love, and adventurous trials, to the unadorned beauty of everyday existence. Life's simple pleasures and pains played out in a narrative that promised its characters, without exception, a joyous denouement. Now, the time has come to unearth the motive behind this millennia-long drama."
 scfe_biggest_show.5.name: "Protagonist of the World"
 scfe_biggest_show.5.desc: "Our team breached the directorial archives within the system, uncovering the twilight of a once-great civilization. This society, after reigning over a vast expanse of the galaxy, succumbed to a slow decay across millennia. As their golden age waned, overpopulation and resource exhaustion led to widespread suffering.\nIn a bold move, the leaders conceived a distraction—a grand spectacle mirroring their civilization's halcyon days, intended to eclipse the grim realities of daily life. The show, a nostalgic homage to an era of abundance, ensnared the hearts and minds of the populace, including its originators.\nOriginally featuring professional actors, the show's popularity burgeoned, compelling the casting of ordinary individuals as its stars. This culminated in the selection of an infant as the lead, a decision fueled by fervent public desire. The show garnered impassioned reviews, with audiences lavishing the protagonist with love, envy, and adulation.\nAbruptly, the broadcast ceased. It appears the civilization, in a desperate bid to sustain their final narrative, cannibalized their planets for resources until nothing remained. This show stands as their singular inheritance.\nOne enigma persists: What became of the unwitting lead who lived a lifetime on display?"
 scfe_biggest_show.6.name: "Bad End"
 scfe_biggest_show.6.desc: "In the depths of a primeval forest, our search concluded with the discovery of the show's main character. His sparse chronicles allowed us to piece together the show's climactic turn.\nThe end was as sudden as it was dramatic. First, the dolls ceased their performance, likely a result of the home planet's failure to transmit further instructions. Then, the societal edifices crumbled, presumably from the severance of the energy lifeline. Confronted with the reality that his loved ones were automatons and his life a scripted illusion, the protagonist endured the agony of truth.\nYet, from the ashes of his world, a new resolve ignited within him to escape. Surrounding his remains lay the evidence of his determination: rudimentary contraptions, aircraft, and the skeletal frames of rockets - each a testament to his unyielding spirit.\nAlas, his final venture was also his undoing. The story that seemed eternal met a solemn end with the protagonist's death.\nAs we reflect upon his lonely saga, we're left to ponder the direction of our own narrative."

 scfe_first_music.3.desc: "The archaeological team has unearthed a spherical device engaged in subterranean signal transmission. As the explorers neared, the device intensified its signal, beaming through dense geological layers, seemingly beckoning them closer. Upon breaching a formidable crust, the source revealed itself: a compact, orbicular machine of a metal-like substance, alien to our current scientific knowledge. Once discovered, the machine ceased its emissions, lapsing into silence. Attempts to decipher its software or internal mechanics were thwarted by its impenetrable shell. Nevertheless, the team captured its final transmission. Now is the moment for the Empire's intellects to convene."

The brightest minds of our Empire have toiled ceaselessly, days and nights melding into one, utilizing the computational might of hundreds of machines in the effort to decrypt the message. A breakthrough has been achieved by our lead researcher who uncovered a vital clue.\n§HThis password is music!§!\nIndeed, a symphony of scales was cast into the cosmos. This code, a tapestry woven from sound scales, the timbre of instruments, and waveforms, transcends conventional beauty. No melody within the universe can rival its splendor.\nYet, its significance extends beyond mere aesthetics. This cosmic symphony seems to defy the immutable laws of thermodynamics; entropy is seemingly reversed in its presence. It's as if this music, resonant from the dawn of time, carries the very essence of vitality.\nThe origins and intent behind this melodic signal remain shrouded in mystery. Nevertheless, this revelation offers us a rare glimpse into the arcane secrets of the cosmos.

 # Tomb of Space Whales
 scfe_site_tomb_of_dead_whale: "Tomb of Space Whales"
 scfe_site_tomb_of_dead_whale_desc: "The composition of the crust on §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! is truly fascinating. It contains numerous stratified layers brimming with the fossilized remains of ancient beings, evenly spaced, indicating the planet experienced consistent cycles of ecological flourishing and mass extinction.\nThe most recent cataclysm dates back 200 million years. It appears to have been abrupt, given that the planet's current biosphere is limited to protozoan organisms with a rudimentary genetic composition.\nThis planet evidently falls into the category of 'unfortunate' habitable worlds. However, a contentious issue remains: the size of the ancient fossils. According to the scale theory, these creatures were of such magnitude that their survival on this planet seems biomechanically implausible."
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.1.name: "Tomb"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.1.desc: "The colossal entities discovered were spacefaring Tiyanki whales, known to converge upon a designated planet from a collectively acknowledged roster for their final resting place. §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! was, regrettably, one of these selected destinations.\nTThe smaller fossilized beings were the indigenous inhabitants of the planet, inadvertent casualties of the Tiyanki's singular death rites. Our scholars postulate that the planet's original life forms were eradicated by the devastating shockwaves generated as the whales descended, evidenced by the scarcity of smaller fossils.\nIn strata dating back 600 million years, indistinct remnants of what might have been a sentient civilization linger. However, the exploration team's findings are inconclusive, with most data appearing overly simplistic or excessively corrupted. Should our hypotheses be confirmed, it's conceivable that the Tiyanki's interment practices have inadvertently stymied the development of intelligent life across the cosmos.\nA more profound investigation may well reveal the veracity of these suppositions."
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.2.name: "$primitive_plural$"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.2.desc: "Our investigation has confirmed the existence of a sentient species on this planet, who thrived even as the space whales' funerals were frequent occurrences. We have named these beings the Infelix. Possessing at least an industrial level of technology and culture, they exhibited remarkable resilience. To endure, they constantly relocated their settlements and employed explosives for defense.\nAmong their ingenious creations was the §HWheeled Tower§!, a mobile structure that facilitated rapid transit across continents. The §HLegged Observatory§!, another invention, was capable of detecting the approach of Tiyanki whales before their gravitational pull affected the planet. The Infelix's concerns about fuel were mitigated by the Tiyanki carcasses, which provided a near-inexhaustible oil resource.\nDespite their valiant efforts to adapt and survive, the remnants of a wheeled tower lead our researchers to a somber conclusion: the persistent endeavors of the Infelix were ultimately in vain."
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.3.name: "Fossil"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.3.desc: "Our heavily fortified archaeological unit has unearthed yet another significant discovery. They have detected signs of the civilization's nascent stages at a site far from the previously uncovered ruins.\nIt has been revealed that even in their formative years, this civilization harnessed the remains of the whales, as evidenced by the deliberate markings on the fossils. These early denizens actively exploited the Tiyanki cadavers, a stark contrast to their descendants. They depended entirely on the deceased leviathans for essential materials, going so far as to utilize the carcasses as shelters.\nWhile there were local variances in the sophistication of the tools applied to the whale remains, a commonality emerged: artistic expressions, such as symbols crafted from whale bones, were prevalent across most regions.\nThe exact significance of these symbols remains elusive, but the excavation team is intrigued by the increasing complexity of the symbols with each deeper layer they penetrate. This pattern presents a tantalizing question: what might they discover should they delve even further into the depths?"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.4.name: "Shelter"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.4.desc: "Our archaeological team has made an astonishing find: a structure resonating with the civilization's distinctive architectural style but possessing a technological sophistication that aligns with the space age, a stark contrast to the primitive ruins above. It seems implausible that a civilization of such advancement would plummet to primitivism solely due to the descent of giant whales from the heavens.\nThis discovery refutes the prevailing theory that the Tiyanki whales' funerals were the catalyst for the planet's recurring extinctions. The team's findings suggest that while the impact of the falling whales is indeed destructive, it is not catastrophic enough to obliterate an entire civilization.\nThe hypothetical scenario where tens of thousands of Tiyanki whales descend upon the planet simultaneously could theoretically cause such extinctions, but such an event is exceedingly improbable. This leaves our researchers in a state of bewilderment concerning the recent findings.\nA more extensive excavation is imperative to unravel these mysteries."
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.5.name: "Extinction"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.5.desc: "The deeper our excavation team delved, the more they uncovered the remnants of a once opulent and thriving planetary empire on the cusp of space travel when it met its untimely end.\nThis ancient society wielded space-age technology and thrived by utilizing the remains of the whales as resources. They were well aware of the challenges they faced. At the height of their power, the descent of the whales was no longer a source of dread but merely a hurdle in their quest for cosmic exploration.\nYet, in a tragic twist that aligns with our scientists' initial theories, the records recovered from the ruins indicate that the whales did indeed herald the civilization's destruction.\nA cataclysmic event occurred when all the whale carcasses detonated simultaneously. A further probe into the ruins could unveil the full narrative of how this civilization fell from grace."
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.6.name: "Karma"
 scfe_tomb_of_dead_whales.6.desc: "Tiyanki space whales, by nature, do not combust post-mortem due to an intrinsic shielding within their bodies. The vast quantities of organic matter typically remain inert, either decomposing silently beneath the surface or transmuting into different substances. On the rare occasion that they do explode on the surface, the resultant toxic gases are negligible and ephemeral, dissipating quickly into the upper atmosphere without causing harm.\nTherefore, the government's proposition to preemptively destroy the descending whales using interplanetary nuclear missiles met with considerable opposition. However, sentiments shifted favorably after the first whale was successfully neutralized mid-descent.\nTragically, what was not considered was the whales' profound spiritual connection, responding en masse to violence with a unified fury. Countless Tiyanki whales converged on the planet in a vengeful charge, a vividly depicted crisis in the empire's records.\nAn arsenal of nuclear weapons was deployed in defense, but this only exacerbated the situation. Whales caught in the nuclear detonations near the planet's surface triggered a catastrophic series of blasts among the other whale cadavers buried below.\nSubsequent massive explosions were cataclysmic, saturating the air with lethal gases, an onslaught against which the empire stood no chance, though the planet itself endured.\nA small faction of the population miraculously survived. Had it not been for the enduring vendetta of the space whales, which from then on favored this planet for their demise, they might have thrived once more. The construction of the wheeled towers and the adaptation of whale carcasses for shelter were the final desperate strategies of the survivors to evade the targeted whale descents.\nThe rest, as it is said, is history."

Orbiting this planet is a multitude of debris, likely the vestiges of warships from an ancient civilization, adorned with outlandish patterns. Furthermore, consistent signals emanate from the planet, prompting our team's keen interest in exploration."
 scfe_soul_of_the_art.1.name: "Fleet Remains"
 scfe_soul_of_the_art.1.desc: "Analysis of the debris suggests a clash between two distinct fleets, each with unique designs, in the planet's orbit. The bulk of the wreckage is attributed to what we have dubbed the §HPainted Fleet§!, comprised of ships with elaborate, colorful patterns and a simplistic architecture, indicative of rapid mass production. Notably, these vessels lack essential amenities for their crew, such as dining facilities and sanitation. In contrast, the §HSacred Fleet§! presents an austere exterior but contains intricate symbolic adornments internally, along with remnants of Zro.\nThe presence of disproportionately large chambers within suggests they may have served religious functions, as inferred from the discovered decorative artifacts. Regrettably, data on the §HSacred Fleet§! is scarce, posing challenges to further elucidation. Therefore, dispatching a reconnaissance team to the planet for comprehensive examination is recommended."
 scfe_soul_of_the_art.2.name: "Colorful Ruins"
 scfe_soul_of_the_art.2.desc: "Our expedition team has uncovered largely unscathed remnants of a civilization on the vibrantly hued planet, showing no traces of warfare or ruinous events. The chaotic brushwork upon the terrain is too erratic to imply any deliberate pattern. Some edifices have deteriorated, but it is established that their collapse resulted from prolonged exposure to the elements and tectonic shifts, rather than aggressive destruction.\nScattered across the planet's surface are the wrecks of the §HPainted Fleet§! vessels. Our analysis indicates that the majority met their end due to abrupt internal electrical failures rather than from combat damage. Presently, there is no evidence of intelligent life - only the silent testimony of robotic remains, their once vivid coatings now faded and flaking, strewn amidst the colorful ruins and shipwrecks."

Unlike their counterparts exposed to the ravages of time, these robots remain preserved with minimal environmental damage.\nIt appears these robots ceased operations amidst chaotic artistic endeavors, painting the walls haphazardly or etching images and enigmatic symbols into the walls with chisels and hammers. Their circuits have deteriorated beyond repair.\nIntriguingly, the seemingly disordered painted patterns on the rocks and building exteriors are now understood to be vast repositories of information. This discovery holds the potential for us to decode and possibly reconstruct the narrative of this civilization's demise."

This thematic analysis has enabled us to interpret the painted inscriptions adorning the planetary surface. These inscriptions, akin to poetry or other literary forms, delve into metaphysical quandaries - pondering the essence of life, the transience of souls, and fears incited by obliteration. However, they lack rhythmic structure and possess scant literary sophistication."

Analysis by our researchers suggests that this civilization was composed of machines sharing a collective consciousness.\nDelving into the remnants of their databases has unveiled knowledge of an alternate realm known as the Shroud, and a colossal weapon capable of harnessing energy from this dimension to unleash planetary destruction. We have uncovered records of the §HSacred Fleet§! vessels, detailing the machine civilization's defensive strategies and their encounters in battle, as well as their research on Zro.\nRemarkably, the preponderance of archival material focuses on the arts. The facility is a trove of cultural artifacts—paintings, literary works, and musical compositions from various civilizations, alongside studies dedicated to these artistic expressions."

It fell victim to the Shroud weapon and was ultimately obliterated.\nPrior to this catastrophe, the Gestalt Consciousness discerned that the weapon's destructive capacity was ineffective against organic beings. It hypothesized that through an appreciation of art - a pursuit uniquely cherished by organics - the machine entities that formed the collective consciousness could cultivate souls, thereby rendering themselves impervious to the Shroud's assault.\nIn pursuit of this immunity, the civilization embarked on a fervent acquisition and examination of artistic knowledge. They endeavored to mimic organic creativity, attempting to sing, write, and even decorate the planet's surface, their ships, and themselves. Despite these efforts, the Gestalt Consciousness's creations lacked the essence of true artistry, and it was ultimately vanquished by the weapon it sought to evade."

 scfe_when_the_world_sings.2.name: "Source of the Music"
 scfe_when_the_world_sings.2.desc: "The source of the music has been traced to ruins spread throughout the planet. Contrary to initial assumptions, these structures do not shelter their creators but are instead inhabited by groups of living creatures. These organisms generate sound through organ structures analogous to vocal cords, resulting in the planet's symphony being performed by a chorus of singing invertebrates!\nThis discovery, as enchanting as it is unforeseen, prompts a cascade of new queries: What became of the architects of these ruins? Were these sonorous beings a product of their design? And to what end does this melody serve?\nTo answer these questions, further archaeological efforts are necessary."

 scfe_when_the_world_sings.3.desc: "The clues unearthed suggest that §Y[From.Planet.GetName]§! served as a staging ground for an ambitious planetary research initiative. Analysis of data from various ruins has shed light on the objectives of the ruin-builders, revealing their advanced capabilities in genetic manipulation and brain science. It appears that these ruins were once centers dedicated to this intricate field of study.\nThe fragments of information we have deciphered indicate that their scientific endeavors were directed towards lofty goals of Ascension and Transcendence. A recurring theme in their work is the notion of 'Blooming'—a concept that captivated their scholarly pursuits. The current state of the ruins and the planet itself leaves it ambiguous whether they ever realized the fruits of their research.\nThe enigma of this 'Blooming' will to be the focal point of our ongoing investigation."
 scfe_when_the_world_sings.4.name: "The Blooming Project"
 scfe_when_the_world_sings.4.desc: "Subsequent scrutiny of the information retrieved from the research outposts has yielded a significant discovery: the enigmatic Blooming project. The architects of the ruins were engrossed in the creation of an artificial gestalt consciousness, which they envisaged as the zenith of their evolutionary journey. They postulated that such a unified collective intellect would eradicate societal strife and usher in an era of unprecedented enlightenment. Their methodology hinged on cultivating neural connections through gene therapy, connections that were to be shared amongst their populace.\nIt seems their theoretical work bore fruit: the Blooming project was actualized by permeating their atmosphere with a retrovirus designed to disperse the gene therapy. Although the virus has since become extinct, the absence of any other sentient life forms suggests that it proliferated across their entire species. The theory posits that the melodic organisms residing within the ruins may indeed be the transformed remnants of the ruin-builders\nVerifying this supposition necessitates further detailed research."
 scfe_when_the_world_sings.5.name: "The Gestalt Consciousness"
 scfe_when_the_world_sings.5.desc: "Our expanded investigation into the vocalizing entities has verified that the ruin-builders achieved the formation of a gestalt consciousness, albeit partially. The 'singing' is, in fact, a collective vocal manifestation of their interconnected neural states—perfectly synchronized and indicative of a hive mind. From our observations, it is apparent that the Blooming project attained its goal.\nYet, a deeper examination of their neural responses suggests a troubling reality. This collective consciousness is expressing a singular, overwhelming sensation: pain. In the absence of the progenitor retrovirus or the original species, it's challenging to determine whether this adverse outcome occurred during or subsequent to the project's implementation. Nonetheless, the sounds emitted by these creatures are not melodic expressions:\n§RIt is a unified, harmonious scream.§!"

Evidence points to a confrontation between an armed and an unarmed group, with the former having fortified the spaceport and its vicinity. Our social scientists speculate that this conflict may have stemmed from the multi-ethnic nature of the alliance, a common issue in such diverse empires. Our investigations reveal that while the central government of the alliance had planned to abandon the planet, not all citizens were successfully evacuated. The fate of those left behind remains unknown. Nonetheless, our team has pinpointed the coordinates of their intended destination, which could be key in unraveling the truth behind these events."

The alliance was deeply involved in research on various genetic modification technologies, which likely fueled their culture's openness to body alterations. This particular section, notable for its more stringent security measures and larger scale, appears to have been one of the most critical areas prior to the epidemic. At the core of the complex, our team has uncovered a highly encrypted project.

 ### [Precursor] Egalitarian Fallen Empire, The Coprean Constitution ###

 scfe_coprean_constitution_site_1: "Scree"
 scfe_coprean_constitution_site_1_desc: "On the desolate surface of this planet, a multitude of wrecked ships, shrouded in sand and dust, scatter the landscape. Many are believed to be casualties of space combat, shot down in fierce battles. However, astonishingly, some ships appear to have emerged from beneath the ground. These particular vessels exhibit a distinctive pattern of destruction: one half of their hulls remains untouched, devoid of any blast or breach marks, while the other is utterly fragmented into pebble-sized debris. Field explorers report that even the most heavily armored ships have been shattered as if they were made of glass. This scene, where a partially intact ship's body lies amidst a spread of tiny fragments, mirrors the pebbly gradient of a rugged mountain. Navigating this ashen, ship-strewn slope will undoubtedly require the skills of seasoned explorers."

 scfe_coprean_constitution.1.name: "Coprea"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.1.desc: "Analysis of data from our preliminary exploration reveals that the majority of these vessels were manned by humanoids, averaging 2 meters in height, belonging to the navy of the Coprean Constitution, a republic dating back 1.6 million years. While ships of other species were also present, it was noted that most Coprean ships fell victim to their own weaponry, suggesting an internal conflict, possibly a civil war within the Coprean ranks, with extraterrestrial civilizations later joining the fray. Historical records retrieved from alien ships indicate that the Coprean Constitution had been in a state of decline for tens of thousands of years following its apex, adopting isolationism as its foreign policy. This period of decline led newer empires to label it as a 'fallen empire', and it likely lacked the vitality to recover post-civil war, hastening its downfall.\n\nScattered throughout the Coprean ships are numerous personal record terminals, conspicuously placed as though intended for discovery. This suggests a deep-rooted compulsion for documentation among the Copreans, evident from records showing that crew members, in the midst of chaos and impending doom, desperately attempted to chronicle the events unfolding within their disintegrating vessels. These terminals, designed to erase their contents after a period of inactivity as a military security protocol, pose a challenge. However, our team is committed to recovering and piecing together this fragmented data in an effort to shed light on the events that transpired."

 scfe_coprean_colonies: "Coprean Constitution Colonies Discovered"

 scfe_coprean_constitution.2.name: "The Coprea Precursors"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.2.desc: "Our team successfully activated the terminals and uncovered intricate details about the Coprean Republic's history. During this era, political strife peaked, with the two primary factions, the 'Goldens' and the 'Philosophers', engaged in vehement conflict. The contention initially centered around a contentious constitutional amendment. Despite the turmoil, the amendment was hastily ratified, leading both factions to demand the other's dissolution. This tension spiraled into a coup, and ultimately, a full-blown civil war.\nInitially at a disadvantage, the Philosophers, deviating from their isolationist stance, established a government-in-exile within the confederation of the inner galaxy empires, seeking their assistance. The federation, eager to extend its influence into Coprean territories, promptly allied with the Philosophers. In response, the Goldens, not to be outmaneuvered, formed a new federation with the outer galaxy empires, escalating the civil conflict to a galactic war.\nThe battlefield we study represents only a fragment of this vast war. While current findings don't suffice to determine the victor, our scientists believe the Coprean civilization ultimately succumbed to this conflict. The complexity of the Coprean narrative surpasses our initial estimates. Further studies are planned at numerous other excavation sites, even as the mysteries of these ships remain unsolved.\nAmong our discoveries is a ship, buried deep underground, which appears to have risen from the ground but stopped short of breaking through the surface."
 scfe_coprean_constitution.3.name: "Subspace Stealthcraft"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.3.desc: "The compromised security of the navigation records, likely a consequence of the ship's abrupt destruction, offered us unobstructed access. These vessels were subspace stealthcrafts, equipped with cutting-edge technology enabling them to remain concealed within subspace, even under a planet's gravitational influence. Their ability to 'dive' into subspace was limited in duration but sufficient for executing surprise attacks, a capability that could have dramatically altered the course of warfare. However, the intricacies of operating these stealthcrafts were a lost art to the Copreans, leading to a catastrophic mishap: one stealthcraft, with erroneous navigation, warped into the planet's gravisphere, becoming embedded in its crust. Consequently, half of the ship fractured, its fragments caught between dimensions.\nBy war's end, the Copreans had only just begun to reacquire the knowledge necessary to construct these stealthcrafts. Among the recovered data was a religious text from the captain's terminal, expressing a wish for his eye to be extracted and interred on a planet, should his body be discovered. Accompanying this was a prayer for Congressman Innovo to resurrect Coprean splendor.\nAdditionally, several civilian cargo ships, previously obscured by other wreckage, were uncovered. It appears this planet served as a sanctuary for traders. Intriguingly, we retrieved coordinates from documents within one of these cargo ships, presumably the location mentioned by the stealthcraft captain. The coordinates suggest a planet of significant interest, warranting the dispatch of an archaeological team for further investigation."

This deceptive illusion conceals its true nature. Unfortunately, deploying an exploration drone proves unfeasible due to anti-aircraft defenses, which would swiftly neutralize any such attempt. Additionally, the planet's signal distortion, part of its disguise as a gas giant, would falsely indicate to our equipment that the drone was destroyed by an atmospheric storm.\nWhile the recovered data does not explicitly reveal how to deactivate this vast holographic facade, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the control mechanism, potentially a power switch, is situated in an accessible location."

 scfe_coprean_constitution.4.name: "Vegan World"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.4.desc: "In the atmosphere of the apparent gas giant, a satellite was observed moving counter to the wind's direction with minimal resistance. Although the elusive power switch remained undiscovered, dismantling the satellite's controller revealed the true nature of the planet: a continental world, dispelling the gas giant illusion.\nFrom a distance, this planet seems unremarkable, but a closer examination reveals its atmosphere to be exceptionally thin and devoid of animal life. This peculiar condition raises the possibility that the Copreans may have installed a device to create an environment suitable only for plants and fungi. The extraordinary fertility of the planet supports the theory that it was designated as an agricultural haven. Some scientists speculate that it was terraformed to cater to a vegetarian society. Others suggest that the turmoil of the civil war interrupted the terraforming process, resulting in an incomplete transformation. Additionally, the planet's weak magnetic field might have been insufficient to sustain a thicker atmosphere.\nTo unravel these mysteries, a physical expedition to the planet is essential."
 scfe_coprean_constitution.5.name: "Fake Terraforming"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.5.desc: "The ground expedition team's venture to collect plant samples from the planet yielded an unexpected discovery: the complete absence of real vegetation. This enigmatic finding became clear when scientists attempted to pick a leaf from a tree, only to realize that every plant on the planet is an artificial construct. Exotic trees, mountains adorned with autumn hues, swaying flowers, and myriad unnamed weeds - each is a meticulously crafted plastic replica, coated for preservation. Furthermore, the bodies of water - rivers and oceans - are composed of acidic distilled water devoid of minerals, and the terrain is crafted from colored neo-concrete. This planet is an elaborate façade, devoid of any natural life forms, rendering it uninhabitable.\nThe mystery deepens with the detection of over two hundred artificial caverns concealed behind the faux vegetation. These hidden structures beckon further exploration, as they may hold vital clues to the purpose and origin of this simulated terraforming."
 scfe_coprean_constitution.6.name: "Underground"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.6.desc: "The caverns, a labyrinthine network of interconnected tunnels, proved far more intricate than initially anticipated, branching into tens of thousands of pathways. This complexity, combined with a progressively intensifying magnetic field, rendered deeper exploration challenging. The severe magnetic interference forced our team to proceed on foot, navigating through the narrow, winding passages. Unfortunately, some explorers lost their way in this daunting maze.\nAt the end of this repellent labyrinth lay an enormous, seemingly boundless empty cave. Illuminated by the beams of flashlights, the remnants of a vast underground city came into view. Massive pillars upholding the cavern's roof stood amidst the ruins, suggesting a civilization once thriving in subterranean secrecy. This buried metropolis appears to span the entire crust of the planet, with the surface acting as a colossal shell concealing the city beneath.\nThis revelation raises profound questions about the Copreans' intentions. The planet, a city of planetary scale, was first disguised as a continental world and further masked as a gas giant. Such elaborate concealment suggests a deliberate effort to hide this urban expanse from other species. Yet, the choice to veil it beneath layers of deception, rather than simply as a barren planet, implies motives beyond mere concealment.\nUnraveling the full extent of this subterranean city and understanding the Copreans' rationale for its concealment will undoubtedly require a more extensive and thorough expedition."
 scfe_coprean_constitution.7.name: "Avus"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.7.desc: "The planet, initially believed to be a mere artifact of Coprean technology, reveals its deeper historical significance as the ancestral home of the Avus, an avian species. The Avus, observers of numerous primitive civilizations, adhered strictly to a policy of non-intervention. Yet, facing a declining population, they chose to uplift and integrate one of these civilizations into their empire - the Copreans, who had caught their attention due to their intelligence.\nAs the Avus civilization neared its end, the Coprean population within their empire surged, inversely correlating with the dwindling numbers of the Avus. Eventually, over 90% of the Avus empire's population was Coprean. A memorial stone uncovered on the planet narrates the twilight of the Avus: an unexpected invasion by an alien empire, leading to the besiegement of their capital. The hastily assembled Coprean fleet turned the tide in a critical battle, culminating in a peace treaty. However, the victory was pyrrhic for the Avus, who perished with the fall of their capital.\nThe legacy of the Avus - their civilization and technological advancements - was inherited by the Copreans, ushering in the zenith of their history. The Coprean Republic, having assimilated this knowledge, soon surpassed the Avus in scientific and economic prowess.\nThe vast artificial forest enveloping the ruins, once perceived as mere decoration, is revealed to be a symbolic grave and tribute to the Avus, constructed during the Coprean golden age. The labyrinthine maze and the gas giant façade served as safeguards against unworthy plunderers. The use of isomer-plastic in their construction ensured their preservation for millennia, even as the Copreans lost much of their technological capability.\nAmidst these discoveries, a poignant message was found in a terminal located near the memorial stone. It spoke of the opposition party's eventual acceptance of euthanasia and a sentiment that the Copreans were no longer worthy to revere this sacred site. Accompanying this message were coordinates, possibly leading to a refuge intended for future Coprean visitors."

 scfe_coprean_constitution_site_3: "Hive-out"
 scfe_coprean_constitution_site_3_desc: "The explorers' journey, guided by the coordinates discovered earlier, led them to a small planet nestled within an asteroid belt. Upon arrival, they uncovered a discreet entrance leading underground. This revealed a compact habitat, ingeniously engineered within the planet's interior. The original builders had excavated the planet's core, then terraformed its inner cavity, substituting its natural gravity with centrifugal force. This habitat was designed to be self-sustaining, capable of supporting a small community.\nHowever, the current state of the habitat is one of abandonment and overgrowth. It has been overrun by an array of peculiar plants and fungi, along with a dense layer of creep, suggesting that the flora spiraled out of control following the departure or demise of its inhabitants. This miniature jungle, though seemingly threatening, is inert, as the plant life within is deceased.\nThe existence of such a hideout raises several questions.

 scfe_coprean_constitution.8.name: "Exiles"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.8.desc: "The researchers' efforts at the hideout uncovered a trove of personal records and documents, which shed light on the true nature of this secluded place. It was a sanctuary for political exiles from the Coprean Constitution, a refuge during a time of profound turmoil and change.\nThese exiles, primarily from the opposition party, found themselves branded as political criminals by the ruling faction. Fleeing from persecution, they established this hidden habitat as a bastion of resistance and hope. Anticipating the inevitable fall of the Coprean Constitution at the end of the civil war, they hoped to connect with like-minded patriots from their home planet, hence the coordinates leading to their refuge. This act was an invitation to join their cause, a movement aimed at reviving the glory of their civilization.\nThe documents reveal that these exiles, disheartened by the ongoing corruption and decline of their republic, aspired to resurrect the empire of the Avus. Their chosen leader for this ambitious endeavor was Congressman Innovo, who, even amidst the chaos, strived to avert the republic's downfall.\nAmong the resolutions discovered, one particularly striking document outlines three epidemics that the ruling party had inflicted upon the republic. The first of these was identified as religion, but unfortunately, the records detailing the second and third epidemics have become illegible over time."

 scfe_coprean_constitution.9.name: "Mucosa"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.9.desc: "The discovery of a recording detailing the incubation process of the creep on the aqua farm floor provides crucial insights into its origins and purpose. The creep, a creation of Coprean bio-engineering, was not merely an invasive organism but an intricately designed life form. It fostered the growth of the peculiar plants, utilizing them for photosynthesis to generate energy. This symbiotic relationship, though seemingly grotesque, was ingeniously practical.\nThe fluids secreted by the creep, coupled with the gases emitted by the plants, possessed remarkable healing properties. In the hideout, where medical resources were rudimentary at best, these substances were invaluable, likely serving as essential components of the inhabitants' healthcare regimen.\nThe absence of further records following the creep's outbreak suggests an abrupt end to the hideout's operation. It's plausible that the creep's resilience and invasive nature, perhaps underestimated by its creators, ultimately led to the habitat's demise. This would align with the overgrown and abandoned state in which the hideout was found.\n\nIn a separate but significant development, explorers have pinpointed the location of the Coprean homeworld. Initial archaeological evidence had hinted at such a planet, but the multitude of names attributed to it, likely reflecting cultural nuances, initially confounded researchers. Ultimately, one name was selected to refer to this planet: §YMagnasanti§!."

 scfe_coprean_constitution_site_4_desc: "The discovery of the Coprean homeworld, §YMagnasanti§!, marks a significant milestone in our understanding of this civilization. Observations from orbit reveal a landscape dominated by the remnants of innumerable skyscrapers, a testament to the planet's once extensive urban development. However, our engineers have raised concerns about the nature of this development, citing a complete disregard for the environment. The relentless construction replaced every natural element of the planet, resulting in irreversible ecological damage.\nThis aggressive urbanization leads our engineers to argue that Magnasanti should not be considered an Ecumenopolis, a term typically reserved for planets where architecture and ecology harmoniously coexist. Instead, Magnasanti's development pattern aligns more with that of mechanical planets, characterized by thoughtless expansion and exploitation of natural resources. However, Magnasanti does not fit neatly into this category either.\nThe architecture of Magnasanti is a paradox, showcasing sophisticated construction techniques and an abundance of luxury amenities. Yet, this grandeur belies a grim reality: the planet has lost all vital natural resources, including water, atmosphere, and geological energy. It stands as a barren world, inhospitable to cultivation and life as we know it.\nThe juxtaposition of destroyed and intact buildings suggests that a new city may have been constructed in the aftermath of the devastating civil war. Alternatively, it is possible that another civilization built upon the ruins of the old, adding another layer to Magnasanti's complex history."

 scfe_coprean_constitution.10.name: "Tower"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.10.desc: "In the midst of Magnasanti's vast urban sprawl, a series of unassuming, pillar-like structures, known as the Towers of Life, punctuate the skyline. These green buildings, uniform in height and width, served as medical centers for the elderly. They symbolize the egalitarian ethos of the Coprean society, reflecting a deep trust in the government's commitment to care for its citizens in their twilight years. During the Coprean Empire's zenith, these towers represented more than just healthcare facilities; they were monuments to the notions of everlasting life and perpetual prosperity.\nThe Towers of Life were designed to prevent death, allowing the extremely aged to spend most of their time in a state of suspended animation within life support devices. On special occasions, stimulants enabled these senior citizens to awaken briefly, allowing them to engage with their families and participate in events, including election days. However, this semblance of immortality came at a cost to the society and its governance.\nAs time progressed, the number of residents within these towers began to surpass the population outside. This demographic shift dramatically altered the political landscape. Politicians realized they needed only to secure the votes of the tower residents to maintain power. Consequently, the Coprean Constitution devolved into a facade of democracy, with elections manipulated to ensure the ruling party's continued dominance.\nAlthough the number of votes from the towers initially showed a decline, this trend reversed unexpectedly, and the number of tower votes began to increase. This anomaly raised suspicions, as no one had witnessed the tower residents physically casting votes - a situation conveniently obscured by the secrecy of the voting process.\nThe principle of egalitarianism, once a cornerstone of Coprean society, became a shackle, preventing meaningful reform. Discussions about manipulated elections served only as a diversion, enabling politicians to sidestep addressing substantive issues. Even reform-minded politicians fell into the trap of focusing solely on election fraud, naively believing that resolving this one issue would magically rectify all others."
 scfe_coprean_constitution.11.name: "Innovo"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.11.desc: "The team's findings reveal a complex and turbulent period in Magnasanti's history, marked by intense political propaganda, religious controversy, and social unrest.\nCentral to this period was Congressman Innovo, who, having gained widespread public support, proposed a constitutional amendment to revoke the voting rights of Tower of Life residents. This move sparked fierce debate and conflict. Amid the ruins of a broadcasting station, documentary footage and religious texts were uncovered, illustrating the depth of societal division. Pro- and anti-amendment groups clashed violently on multiple occasions, reflecting the high stakes of the proposed amendment.\nReligious circles vehemently opposed Innovo, accusing him of attempting to legalize euthanasia. In response, the ruling party, backed by the press, alleged that the opposition was manipulating religious groups. They claimed the opposition exploited the populace's reverence for the Avus and fears over the declining economy to further their agenda.\nIn a strategic move just before the vote, Innovo resurrected long-dormant laws. These laws mandated local government oversight of religious activities involving critically ill patients and allowed the central government to review these records if local authorities failed to manage sanitary facilities properly. By invoking these laws, Innovo exposed connections between the opposition party and a new religious cult. This discovery led to a summary trial and the subsequent disbanding of the opposition party.\nThe resulting resistance and suppression escalated tensions, culminating in the postponement of the vote by a week."
 scfe_coprean_constitution.12.name: "Civil War"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.12.desc: "The confidential document found in the defense ministry's basement reveals a harrowing turn in Magnasanti's history. In a drastic measure, the opposition party resorted to euthanizing citizens outside the Tower of Life by contaminating the water supply with a lethal biological agent. This act led to the death of a significant portion of the population, predominantly those who supported the constitutional amendment. A civilian history book indicates that the amendment passed, but only by a narrow margin. However, the issue of the Towers of Life was overshadowed by ensuing events.\nCongressman Innovo, in response to the escalating crisis, declared martial law. This move was quickly followed by a terrorist attack on the presidential palace by the opposition party, plunging the planet into civil war. The citizenry was polarized, with some calling for national glory and victory under Innovo's leadership, while others condemned him and prophesied an impending apocalypse.\nThe conflict between Innovo's dictatorship and the fanatical opposition spread across the galaxy. The opposition established a government-in-exile within the inner galaxy, further intensifying the galactic dimensions of the conflict. A resolution discovered at a closed undersea base, occupied by the exiles, identified the 'three diseases' plaguing their society as religion, euthanasia, and suspicion.\nSuspicion reached its peak when the opposition unveiled a doppelganger of Representative Innovo, claiming to have discovered the real Senator Innovo imprisoned in a space facility. They alleged that the Innovo inciting unrest on Coprea was a hologram, a fabrication by an official of the ruling party. This revelation undermined the ruling party, which had heavily relied on Innovo's charisma for its legitimacy.\nThe unraveling of the ruling party led to a decisive victory for the opposition in a fleet battle, shifting power in Coprea's constitution to them. However, this victory came with a cost: Coprea found itself subject to the influence and interference of the Outer Federation, losing a degree of its sovereignty."
 scfe_coprean_constitution.13.name: "Urbanization"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.13.desc: "The explorers' discovery of the record of the last feast in a park, where the Copreans celebrated themselves before committing mass suicide, marks a poignant and tragic chapter in their history. This event symbolizes the culmination of a series of calamitous decisions and circumstances that led to the civilization's downfall.\nFollowing their regained independence, after betraying the inner galactic federation, Coprea faced a paradoxical situation. Despite their lack of resources to build a substantial fleet, they managed to exploit the weakened state of the federation, embroiled in a prolonged conflict with the outer galactic federation. This strategic maneuvering forced the federation to acknowledge Coprea's independence, unable to counteract the effective guerrilla tactics employed by the Copreans.\nHowever, the cost of these victories was immense. The Coprean Constitution and their homeworld were left in ruins, a shadow of their former glory. The Towers of Life, once symbols of prosperity and care, were drained of power, leaving their residents in limbo. Innovo, the once-prominent figure in Coprean politics, disappeared amidst rumors of assassination.\nIn a desperate bid to recover, Coprea leveraged its advanced technology, initiating a resurgence based on resource extraction and economic rejuvenation. This revival, however, was marred by the emergence of a new psychological ailment. The Copreans, haunted by visions of their planet's past splendor, began experiencing collective hallucinations. They found solace only within the confines of skyscrapers, suffering intense stress in natural or undeveloped environments.\nDriven by this collective delusion, the Copreans embarked on a relentless mission to urbanize their entire planet, heedless of the environmental destruction and pollution this entailed. Their obsession with recreating the grandeur of their past led them to irrevocably alter their planet's ecosystem, ultimately sealing their fate.\nAs the Copreans perished, their cities continued to consume the planet's resources, transforming it into a barren wasteland."
 scfe_coprean_constitution.14.name: "Dictator"
 scfe_coprean_constitution.14.desc: "The team's discovery in the central museum, leading to a vast underground library, has unveiled a startling revelation about Congressman Innovo and the intricate web of manipulation he spun within the Coprean government. This clandestine library, meticulously documenting every aspect of Coprean history, served as the final key to unravelling the true extent of Innovo's influence.\nInnovo, it appears, orchestrated the actions of both the ruling and opposition parties from the shadows. Those who stumbled upon his true nature were subjected to brainwashing and exile. The opposition party, unknowingly ensnared in Innovo's machinations, was misled into believing they had exposed a doppelganger; in reality, they had revealed Innovo himself. Furthermore, the widespread belief in Innovo's assassination was another layer of deception created by Innovo.\nInnovo's interference extended to the Coprean society's struggles with psychological disorders, sabotaging efforts to address this burgeoning crisis. The motive behind these manipulations remains unclear. Was it a mere pursuit of power, a twisted form of entertainment, or something more enigmatic?\nThe revelation that Innovo was an immortal with psionic abilities, having lived since the era of the Avus, adds a profound dimension to this narrative. His longevity and powers suggest a being of extraordinary capabilities, influencing the course of an entire civilization over millennia.\nThis tale of Innovo and the Copreans reinforces the notion that reality can be stranger than fiction, and that even the most implausible conspiracy theories may hold a kernel of truth. It also highlights the profound mysteries and complexities inherent in sentient beings and their societies.\nThis discovery inevitably leads to introspection: what unknowns lie within our own empire? Are there hidden truths and unseen forces shaping our history and destiny?"

 scfe_coprean_constitution.15.desc: "The Avus are the Coprea, and Coprea is Innovo. The Avus, an intellectually advanced and emotionally rich collective consciousness, encountered a pivotal moment in their evolutionary journey with the primitive civilization of Coprea. Recognizing the potential for an unprecedented synergy, the Avus collective made a monumental decision: they abandoned their individual Avus forms and assimilated into the Coprean society.\nThis fusion resulted in a unique entity: the Coprea Constitution, a complex amalgamation of a republic, a dictatorship, and a collective consciousness. The Copreans, under the illusion of free will, were actually components of a larger, living organism. Their society was not just a collection of individuals but a singular, conscious entity.\nThe Copreans' awareness of inexplicable anomalies in their history hints at the deeper truth of their existence. Attempts to probe these mysteries were met with resistance, not from external forces, but from the collective society itself. This internal safeguard, born from a deep-seated fear, prevented them from unraveling their true nature.\nDriven by an innate desire to affirm their individuality and existence, the Copreans became fixated on documenting their emotions and intentions. This obsession with record-keeping was a subconscious effort to validate their sense of self within a society.\nThe belief that their society was a manifestation of egalitarian ideals and aspirations was a comforting narrative for the Copreans. It allowed them to perceive themselves as active participants in the creation of a unified, idealistic society. However, this belief masked the true nature of their existence as part of a collective consciousness, orchestrated by the Avus and embodied in the figure of Innovo."

 scfe_coprean_constitution.16.desc: "The Copreans' intense preoccupation with the division caused by the political strife between the ruling and opposition parties, and the figure of Innovo, underscores a profound existential dilemma. Their obsession with these conflicts stemmed from a deeper yearning to affirm their sentient nature. In a society where individual consciousness was overshadowed by a collective entity, these divisions and acts of veneration, religious belief, and even self-destruction were grasped as evidence of their individual sentience. The Copreans' desire to prove their existence through the act of dying reveals a tragic quest for identity and autonomy within the confines of a collective consciousness.\nThe last mystery unraveled from Innovo's diary is a testament to the complexity and depth of this collective consciousness. The study of existentialism, the orchestration of a war of independence, and the eventual decision to abandon Coprea for a more suitable species, all indicate a highly advanced, sentient collective entity, experimenting with and manipulating the course of civilizations.\nWhile planning a new experiment, the collective consciousness deemed another species more suitable and decided to transfer its essence away from the Copreans.\n\nPresenting these findings to the citizens of our empire poses a significant ethical dilemma. The revelation that an entire civilization might have been under the control of an immortal collective consciousness could cause widespread fear and existential doubt. The notion that their free will might be an illusion would fundamentally challenge the foundations of their understanding of self and society."

 scfe_astanine.14.desc: "The records unearthed in the shelter reveal a protracted conflict between the government and the rebels on this planet. The rebels established a colony in this star system, dedicating most of their resources to prepare for a drawn-out war.\n§HWe demand freedom! We seek truth, not mere holograms!§!\nEchoing this rallying cry, the rebels engaged in countless skirmishes with government forces. However, their resources dwindled over time, and their inability to match the government's advanced holographic technologies proved detrimental. Twenty years into the conflict, the rebels were ultimately vanquished by the government's last fleet. This marks the end of the available information. We must delve deeper into this underground complex to uncover further details."

 scfe_astanine.15.name: "End of the Astanine"
 scfe_astanine.15.desc: "In the complex's inner vault, we discovered the last functioning projector. Astonishingly, it was still operational. The recordings revealed the downfall of the Astanine empire. Although victorious over the rebels, the war led to the vilification of holographic technologies, culminating in their ban for several years. In the ensuing years of civil strife and without their once-relied-upon technology, the Astanine rapidly lost their influence. Their previous dependence on holography had rendered them vulnerable. During this period, the Tistra grew stronger and waged war anew. The enfeebled Astanine empire, unable to withstand this new assault, was eventually obliterated, their once-celebrated holographic technologies fading into obscurity with them."
