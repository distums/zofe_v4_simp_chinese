This architectural strategy has necessitated the careful deactivation of still-active defense systems by our team to secure passage deeper into the facility.\nUpon breaching into one of the inner spheres, the team was greeted by an environment remarkably preserved compared to the war-torn exterior. It is evident that the station's design was intended to withstand sieges of immense magnitude. However, the destructive capacity of the dark matter weaponry employed by the attackers left its mark even in these depths.\nA significant discovery was made within this inner section: thousands of robots, intact and dormant within their charging pods - a vast, slumbering army, awaiting an activation command that, due to the station's catastrophic defeat, was never issued.\nThe expedition is now faced with the challenge of progressing further into the warbase, which requires bypassing a heavily reinforced gateway leading to the core. The gateway is equipped with security measures that, if triggered, could potentially activate the dormant robots or initiate other defensive protocols. Our team is preparing to employ advanced hacking techniques to infiltrate the gateway's controls without raising alarms, a task that demands precision and expertise."
 scfe_shaded_warform_dig.4.name: "Generator Sphere"
 scfe_shaded_warform_dig.4.desc: "Following the successful breach of the reinforced gateway, we have entered one of the warbase's most inner spheres, housing its critical systems short of the central control itself. This section contains the vast generator systems that powered the warbase, alongside numerous internal fabrication units designed for the assembly of robots, attack vessels, and essential spare parts.\nThrough adept hacking and data retrieval efforts, our scientists have reconstructed the warbase's final moments. It became evident that a surprise attack by a formidable fleet of Fallen Empire vessels, utilizing advanced weaponry coupled with a sophisticated electronic warfare system, was the catalyst for the warbase's downfall. This assault induced a critical error in the mainframe, compelling it into sleep mode, and subsequently, its crash landing on the planet's surface where it has remained undisturbed for over 9000 years. From here, we have access to the warbase's inner systems, which allows us to open the gateway to the central core."
 scfe_shaded_warform_dig.5.name: "The Central Core"
 scfe_shaded_warform_dig.5.desc: "Upon successful entry into the command core of the warbase, our science team has accessed the central database, revealing pivotal information about the warbase's operational directives.\nThe machine empire's campaign against the Shaded Empire was not of its own devising. It acted under orders, systematically eliminating the Shaded Empire's pawns and influence across the galaxy. However, its efforts to locate the hidden homeworld of the Shaded Empire proved fruitless.\nThe last communication received by the warbase was a cold declaration that they outlived their usefulness, followed by the initiation of a devastating surprise attack. The evidence unequivocally suggests that a Fallen Empire orchestrated the machine empire's genocidal mission against the Shaded Empire.\nAmong the wealth of data, the team uncovered a set of coordinates leading to locations that the machine empire had yet to investigate. We may find more clues in one of these locations."
