 scfe_reverse_engine_category: "Buried civilization"
 scfe_reverse_engine_desc: "The scanners of our science ship have detected a signal deep under the surface of a devastated world. Our team wants to send an expedition on §Y[Root.GetName]§! to dig to its source."
 scfe_failed_hive_category: "Ruined Civilization"
 scfe_failed_hive_desc: "The scanners of our science ship have detected the ruins of an advanced civilization on §Y[Root.GetName]§!. Our crew is eager to investigate."
 scfe_lonely_shroud_category: "An impossible message"
 scfe_lonely_shroud_category_desc: "Our science vessel has stumbled upon a shrouded world in the depths of this system. As it draws closer, anomalous emissions pique the crew's curiosity. Could there be a hidden intelligence trying to communicate with us on this cursed world?"
 scfe_war_torn_category: "Devastated planet"
 scfe_war_torn_category_desc: "Our science ship's scanners reveal evidence of a significant orbital bombardment inflicted upon §Y[Root.GetName]§! in the distant past."
 scfe_the_first_music_anomaly: "The First Music"
 scfe_the_first_music_anomaly_desc: "While exploring §Y[Root.GetName]§!, we repeatedly received a very strong signal. Our scientists claim that violent solar winds have been observed in the star system, but this signal is not from natural factors such as solar wind.\n\nOur scientists have determined that this is an artificial signal, and given how easily we found it, it seems that we need to study this signal."

 # Strange Worlds
 scfe_woorskyr_world_category: "Towering Above the Mountains"
 scfe_woorskyr_world_category_desc: "The most striking aspect of §Y[Root.GetName]§! is the presence of a colossal tree, seemingly encircling the planet and towering over the mountains. Our empire's botanists are fervently advocating for an in-depth study of this extraordinary tree to gain a deeper understanding of its nature."
 scfe_koeleothan_world_category: "Moving Masses Below the Waves"
 scfe_koeleothan_world_category_desc: "Our crew has observed huge swathes of movement below the waves of §Y[Root.GetName]§!. They request to allow further study of this phenomenon to determine what is the cause."
 scfe_xenograss_world_category: "Alien Crop Fields"
 scfe_xenograss_world_category_desc: "While conducting a sampling mission on §Y[Root.GetName]§!, the survey team unearthed a unique grass species. Its unusual composition and growth cycle suggest it is not native to this world. Intriguingly, this grass predominantly thrives in a cluster of large craters, leading our scientists to theorize that it was introduced to the planet by a significant meteorite event centuries ago. In light of this discovery, they've requested an extended mission to further explore these expanses of alien grass. They also humorously assure us that they will refrain from creating any crop circles during their investigation."
 scfe_quantumpearl_world_category: "A World of a Thousand Wolds"
 scfe_quantumpearl_world_category_desc: "While conducting a thorough survey and catalog of §Y[Root.GetName]§!, our scanners momentarily detected thousands of anomalous readings that did not align with any specific targeted location. Puzzled by this, our exploration team persisted in their survey, making a note to return to this peculiar site for a more detailed investigation."
 scfe_beetle_world_category: "The Beetle in Waiting"
 scfe_beetle_world_category_desc: "On our initial expedition to §Y[Root.GetName]§!, we encountered an unexpected welcome, not from a sentient being but from a remarkably perceptive beetle. This beetle displayed an uncanny ability to anticipate our arrival and movements on the planet, as if it were always observing us. Following the completion of our survey, several of our entomologists have expressed a keen interest in extending their stay to conduct a more thorough study of this intriguing insect."
 scfe_vanishing_act_category: "Inhabited Planet"
 scfe_vanishing_act_category_desc: "Our science vessel has arrived in orbit of §Y[Root.GetName]§! and immediately detects traces of a spacefaring civilization. The crew is preparing to initiate the first contact procedure."
