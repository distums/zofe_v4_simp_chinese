As if that wasn't enough, the §H[Banisher.GetSpeciesAdj]§! soldiers then helped themselves and took everything from our treasuries. Every scrap of food has been taken from the hands of our people as repayment for the war.\n\nIn addition to arms restrictions, the treaty also dictated that the §H[Banished.GetName]§! is forbidden to return to galactic affairs, or influence younger races in any way.
