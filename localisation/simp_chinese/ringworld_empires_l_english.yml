Remnants of ancient warships lay buried here, yet for some unknown reason, they seemed strangely familiar. A team of archaeologists soon joined the investigation and disturbingly, these designs match the primitive drawings made by our §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! ancestors. How can this be? These ships predate our earliest records of §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! history, when spaceflight should have been impossible.\n\nWhile biologists look uncomfortable revising existing theories on §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! evolution, physicists and engineers are excited by the technologies found on these ships. The weaponry are beyond our current understanding of physics, and the way these ships were assembled and made capable of spaceflight seems well beyond our experience in engineering. To settle this once and for all, our top scientists proposed a restoration project to determine if these machines were actually capable of spaceflight. This would require significant resources, of course.\n\nWho were our ancestors? Who built the massive structure on which we live? These shipwrecks seem to hold all the answers to our past."

Remnants of ancient warships lay buried here, yet for some unknown reason they seem vaguely familiar.

While there is a general unease from our autonomous drones with stirring the [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle]'s memory further, our [Root.GetScientistPlural] are eager to dissect the vessel's secrets and bring this knowledge to the Hive. The weaponry is beyond our current understanding of physics, and the way these ships were assembled seems well beyond our current engineering experience. To properly understand these vessels and the technology within, our [Root.Owner.GetScientistPlural] have assembled the brightest among them to determine if these vessels were ever capable of spaceflight, and if they can be restored to functional order.

A team of [GetArchaeologistPlural] were dispatched to investigate further, and confirmed that these vessels predate our oldest chronological timestamps, from before the first [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName] unit activated on this ringworld. The weaponry these vessels possess defies quantified physical understanding, and the construction techniques applied to them is beyond our capacity to replicate. The presence of material evidence before the first online unit has spurred a priority shift within the [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitle], and the most adaptable research subroutines have been gathered to investigate the crafts further - and if possible, restore them to function.

But then the engine roared to life, awakening a warship that was thought long-dead. Weapons, life-support, hyperdrive, all came online, announced by the ship's AI in ancient §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! dialect. It is buried and forgotten no more.\n\nWe managed to reactivate a few more ships this way, and our admirals could not be more excited to get their hands on these ships and see them in action. However, our scientists warned against reverse-engineering any of the ships' technologies, or install our own modifications, as their workings are still not understood by modern science. 'I don't know how, but it works and it doesn't explode,' one engineer said grumpily. 'So don't ruin it.'\n\nIt is now increasingly evident that we did not descend from primitives like we thought. Our real ancestors before those primitives possessed technologies far beyond our own, and it would not be above them to construct the Ringworld on which we now live. Some archaeologists suggest we were once a significant power in the galaxy, yet for some reason our ancestors lost everything and became the primitives we knew. But how?\n\nIntentionally or not, our ancestors have left us these warships to find. Was it a mistake, or were they hoping that future generations would one day reclaim their rightful place in the galaxy? Had they discovered some unspeakable horror, or encountered enemies so numerous, that they abandoned their empire out of self-preservation? Whatever the answer, it seems we are about to discover it for ourselves all over again."
 ringworld_empire.2.desc.hive:0 "Our drones first reported it as a hum. It was faint at first, like an echo of thought from the Hive Mind rolling over even the most distant drones. But then the vessel's engine roared to life, awakening a warship that was long thought dead and buried. Weapons, life support, hyperdrive - all came online, felt through the drones onboard as the vessel spoke to them much like our synaptic nodes. It is buried and forgotten no more.\n\nOur drones managed to reactivate a few more ships this way, and our warrior drones can barely contain their excitement for such lethal additives to their arsenal. However, our [GetScientistPlural] warned against any tampering - these vessels may be custom suited to §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! physiology, but we do not yet understand their construction or technology. Modification may lead to irreparable damage or harm, and we have been encouraged to give a 'gentle' touch in regards to any functions aboard these vessels.\n\nIt is now increasingly evident the Hive did not emerge from the ecology of this structure, as we once thought. We once roamed the stars, and with the technology these vessels posses, it is not impossible to think our mind shaped this very megastructure we reside upon. Some of our archeology drones suggest that we were once a significant power in the galaxy, yet for some reason, the mind became fractured and feral, regressing to the state we exist in now. But how?\n\nIntentionally or not, we left these vessels for ourselves to find once more. Was it a mistake, or were they hoping that future spawn would reclaim their rightful place in the galaxy? Had the mind found an intelligence to rival itself, or countless enemies without, that they willfully retreated to this ruined holding out of self preservation? Whatever the answer, it seems we are about to discover it for ourselves all over again."
 ringworld_empire.2.desc.machine:0 "Optimal functionality to the derelict vessel has been restored. Local audio-receptors of assigned drone-crew reported a faint but steady increase in the engine's primary output that reverberated throughout the ship, terminating at a consistent audial discharge that was adjusted for appropriately. Following the primary power-supply's restoration, secondary systems were returned to functionality with unexpected levels of integrity, coordinated by the vessel's integrated intelligence in outdated, yet recognizable §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! coding language. The vessel is buried and deserviced no more.\n\nSeveral other vessels were restored in similar manner to function, and fleet-management algorithms have updated our projected combat-strength accordingly. The research subroutines assigned to this restoration effort have input cautionary addendums to this success; The modification and attempted reverse-engineering of the technologies aboard the active vessels is strictly unadvised. We do not yet understand the methodology or technology behind the construction, and despite the physical and network compatibility to §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName]§! units, many secondary functions of the vessels are yet unknown. Modification could result in unexpected termination of function, as one subroutine has posited.\n\nThe presence of the vessels, and evidence of integrated compatibility to networked units, has firmly secured an already likely probability of our origin; we did not originate here, and our activation on this structure has been reclassified as re-activation in response. With the technologies these vessels possess, it is not unlikely to hypothesize that the ringworld we inhabit was within our power to construct as well. The previous iteration of our intelligence appears to have been significantly advanced, leading our research subroutines to another question. Why has this downgrade occurred?\n\nDid outside factors dismantle us? Is this instance of our central processing no more than a backup boot, in the event of complete and utter destruction? These vessels were left inactive and secure for our drones to discover. Perhaps we are a contingency plan after all, and we have finally fulfilled our previous iteration's directives."

Still wearing proudly the insignia of this §HNemesis§!, Doomgiver would have ambushed enemy fleets jumping out of hyperspace, blasting them with its weapons, and shocking enemy admirals that they were being blasted by one of their own ships. At least, that was our ancestor's idea of revenge.\n\nAt some point, the restoration project was abandoned. Our ancestors presumably lost the war and became the primitives we knew in §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! history. One has to wonder though, if they hadn't lost the war, where would we be now?

Still wearing the colors and heraldry of this §HNemesis§!, Doomgiver would have emerged from hyperspace right behind enemy fleets, firing upon them with its weapons and sowing terror and confusion among their fleet commanders. At least, this was the Mind's idea of revenge.\n\nAt some point, this restoration project was abandoned, buried away for our drones to find once more. It stands to reason the hive was defeated, our Mind sequestering away to this isolated retreat and devolving, until our drones awakened to sentience once more - as §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! history. The Mind wonders though, if it hadn't lost the war, where would we be now? More importantly, what happened to the §HNemesis§! who destroyed our hive?

Still adorned in the visual markings of this §HNemesis§!, Doomgiver would have engaged in deceptive strikes against engaged fleet-assets, firing its payload onto unsuspecting fleet-command units believing it to be an allied vessel. This strategy is the most logical explanation either way.\n\nDue to unknown factors, this stratagem was abandoned, the vessel buried and left forgotten for us to rediscover. It is with high probability that our previous iteration lost the macro-scale engagement shortly after, and was forced to activate its backup core, reducing us to the inferior units that we know from §H[Root.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! history. The Central Intelligence wonders though - if our previous iteration had not lost the war, where would it be now? More importantly, what happened to the §HNemesis§! who destroyed it?
