 situation_zofe_ascension:0 "The Zenith of Fallen Empires"
 situation_zofe_ascension_desc:0 "At the height of their power, the Fallen Empires were masters of the galaxy and all possibilities were within reach.\n\nBut the path to greatness is not always linear, and at times choices and sacrifices must be made. Now it is our turn to choose."
 situation_zofe_ascension_monthly_change_tooltip:0 "The progress of this §YSituation§! is dependent on the §YApproach§! we pick. Increase our investments to speed up the ascension process."
 
 zofe_ascension_stage_0_tooltip:0 "All levels of society are to be mobilized, bracing themselves for a revolution brought about by the discovery of §Y$tech_dark_matter_power_core$§!."
 zofe_ascension_stage_1_tooltip:0 "Using an advanced form of Dark Matter manipulation, the precursors' technological mastery enabled entire industries to run autonomously, freeing their population to live out the rest of their lives in self-determined and hedonistic ways.\n\nIf we apply ourselves to study how Dark Matter is manipulated in this way, we will be able to replicate and rebuild these technological marvels for a fully efficient economy."
 zofe_ascension_stage_2_tooltip:0 "At the zenith of civilisation, citizens are united by a single, fanatical ideal. With their thunderous applause, our society will transform, unlocking new civics and buildings for our Ascended Society."
 zofe_ascension_stage_3_tooltip:0 "Unfortunately, our ships and cities still take the same appearance as the first day we achieved spaceflight, which no longer reflect an empire of our current stature. Perhaps some designs borrowed from our precursor neighbours would both serve to intimidate our enemies and deter future invasions.\n\nBlueprints and technical data for these elegant precursor designs can be obtained through various covert operations spanning several years."
 zofe_ascension_stage_4_tooltip:0 "The precursor empires were masters of warfare, their doctrines tried and tested by the fires of the Great Crusade. Studying precursor combat tactics and their weaponry will greatly enhance our own capabilities, allowing us to fight with a millennia of experience and lessons born of the Great Crusade."
 zofe_ascension_stage_5_tooltip:0 "We must have galactic ambitions befitting of our stature and power, projecting our influence across all edges of the galaxy. New edicts and campaigns would ensure the continued prosperity and stability of our empire."

 situation_zofe_dark_matter_desc:0 "Our [GetScientistPlural] have concluded that §Y$tech_dark_matter_power_core$§! is in fact the foundation of precursor empires and their wonderous technologies. Unlocking its secrets would in turn, propel our civilization to be amongst the most advanced in this galaxy."

 situation_zofe_dark_matter_monthly_change_tooltip:0 "The progress of this §YSituation§! is dependent on the §YApproach§! we pick."
 
 zofe_dark_matter_stage_0_tooltip:0 "As a first step, our [GetScientistPlural] propose we set up a lab to study all the properties of §Y$sr_dark_matter$§!. After all, how could we make something of §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! if it is, by definition, invisible?\n\nMany papers will be published during this periord about the characteristics of §Y$sr_dark_matter$§!, and our science team will attempt to build new instruments to further our research and understanding of this elusive substance."
 zofe_dark_matter_stage_1_tooltip:0 "Now that we have understood how to activate §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! for it to be usable, we require a new reactor design to store them. There remain engineering challenges to overcome, since §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! can only be activated at extreme temperatures with agents at a specific pressure.\n\nDespite being a potentially dangerous phase of our research, our [GetScientistPlural] are unfazed by the challenges ahead."
 zofe_dark_matter_stage_2_tooltip:0 "To unlock the true potential of §Y$sr_dark_matter$§!, it must first be activated and then split up by firing particles at it to create fission, releasing enough energy to power a whole civilization, and a new age.\n\nHowever, finding the right particles and firing at it accurately is tricky, unless we find a way to bend the gravitational fields around where the fusion takes place. If this conundrum is solved, we will be one step closer to achieving a real breakthrough."
 zofe_dark_matter_stage_3_tooltip:0 "Having successfully overcome the challenges in creating §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! Fission, our [GetScientistPlural] now set their sights on creating a functioning prototype that could sustain §Y$sr_dark_matter$§! Fission by itself.
