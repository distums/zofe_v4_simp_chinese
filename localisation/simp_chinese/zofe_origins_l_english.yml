The weaponry are beyond our current understanding of physics, and the way this ship was assembled and made capable of spaceflight seemed well beyond our experience in engineering.

All the while, it was analysing our signals, reading our signatures, and immediately activated all of its engines and weapon systems.\n\nWhen our science vessel noticed this, we hailed the giant ship to state our intentions, and then it just started... following us. It was almost as if parts of our energy signatures awoke something deep within the ship's databank.\n\nIt seems this ship will now follow us wherever we go."
 original_people.4001.a:0 "What use is this massive ship following us?"
 
 original_people.400.name:0 "The Golden City"
 original_people.400.desc:0 "§YThe Golden City§! that was the capital of the ancient [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] empire had long been reduced to shattered lumps of rocks, but its debris could provide a great deal of insight on its age, its technological progress at the time, and could tell us a lot about our missing culture. We should send a team there and examine the planetary debris."
 original_people.400.a:0 "Let's see what we can find."

 original_people.401.name:0 "Utopian World"
 original_people.401.desc:0 "Having studied the remains of §YThe Golden City§!, we have learned that it was once a Utopian World, where fields of golden grass and singing towers gave birth to the ancient [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Their civilization developed quickly, achieving spaceflight roughly 30000 years ago. Among the many primitive empires they encountered, [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] were regarded as gods from heaven, and the primitives paid tribute in droves. With all this wealth, majestic spires were built - one of the wonders of the galaxy - but there is no sight of that now."
 original_people.401.a:0 "How sad."

 original_people.402.name:0 "The First Galactic Imperium"
 original_people.402.desc:0 "Around some 20000 years ago, with the backing of the galactic community, the ancient [From.Owner.GetSpeciesAdj] empire became the First Galactic Imperium, in a bid to achieve a safe and secure society. And thus the Original Empire was born, and [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] became known as simply the Original People. As the only species to have achieved Dark Matter Fusion, whenever crises arose, it was always the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] that protected the galaxy from annihilation, and for the next 10000 years, the Original Empire reigned supreme and seemed all but invincible.\n\nTowards the end of the Original Empire's reign, the [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] found themselves fighting on multiple fronts. An earlier than anticipated activation of the Contingency, extra-dimensional invaders, and 'terrifying creatures' from interstellar space had struck simultaneously in all corners of the galaxy. Their fleets and supplies became overstretched, while their vassals contributed little to the war effort. The Imperial Armada began losing ships faster than they could replace, and for some, this became an opportunity."
 original_people.402.a:0 "We were the First Galactic Imperium?"

 original_people.403.name:0 "The Last Battle"
 original_people.403.desc:0 "The last battle of the Great Crusade was fought over §YThe Golden City§!. Recovered holorecords tell us that Sky Trench was activated, where five-hundred interwoven layers of planetary shield protected the §YThe Golden City§! from bombardment. Distress signals were sent to the frontline fleets: return and save the city.\n\nBut before a final relief effort could be made, a terrible weapon was unleashed on §YThe Golden City§!, cracking the planet in half. Billions of [From.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural] perished in an instant. With the signal tower destroyed, no further reinforcements were to arrive aside from a lone Goliath, but by then, the coalition fleets have moved on, and the heart and soul of the Original Empire was no more."
 original_people.403.a:0 "If only we could replicate the distress signal..."
 original_people.403.b:0 "It's too risky."
 
 ORIGINAL_PEOPLE_DISTRESS_SIGNAL:0 "Distress Signal Tower"
 ORIGINAL_PEOPLE_DISTRESS_SIGNAL_DESC:0 "If we could somehow replicate the distress signal patterns, using familiar energy signatures, we could broadcast it into the voids of space. If there were still ships of the ancient Imperial Armada remain, they might respond to our signal and return."

 original_people.5000.name:0 "Distress Signal Replicated"
 original_people.5000.desc:0 "After cross-referencing data found on the debris of §YThe Golden City§! with the various warships we have collected, our engineers have been able to build a signal tower capable of calling out into deep and uncharted space. If any of our ancestors' ships are still out there, they might return once they receive our distress signal, and aid us in the battles to come."
 original_people.5000.a:0 "Activate it!"
 
 original_people.5004.name:0 "A Vessel Responded"
 original_people.5004.desc:0 "Earlier, a vessel showed up to [Root.Capital.GetName], orbiting it, seemingly in response to our distress signal. Perhaps given enough time, the remnants of the old Imperial Armada will return to us one by one, and when they are gathered, the Original Empire shall be reborn."
 original_people.5004.a:0 "Welcome home!"
 
 original_people.6000.name:0 "Original Empire Structures"
 original_people.6000.desc:0 "After compiling more of the data from our previous excavations, our scientists are reasonably certain that the Original Empire in fact, had highly advanced automated industries unlike anything we had ever seen. Perhaps we should find ways to recreate these miracle technologies of the past."
 original_people.6000.a:0 "We should recover all of our technologies."
 original_people.6000.b:0 "No, it's too much effort."
 
 original_people.6001.name:0 "Recovery Successful"
 original_people.6001.desc:0 "Our scientists have been successful in their recovery of blueprints for several ancient Original Empire structures. Their functions and capabilities show great potential for our present economy."
 original_people.6001.a:0 "Good!"
