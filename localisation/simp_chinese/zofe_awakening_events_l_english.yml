Abandon your pursuits now: the §H[fallen_empire_warner.GetName]§! and the §H[fallen_empire_warner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! people will not accept another Machine Ascendancy meddling in galactic affairs."

 zofe_awakening.102.desc.a:0 "You dare disobey the spirits?\n\nPerhaps it is time to teach you foul machines a lesson. Yes...a swift victory over you soulless husks would please the §H[fallen_empire_warner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! populace, and demonstrate to the galaxy once and for all that crude metal constructs can never triumph over the faithful."
 zofe_awakening.102.desc.b:0 "The spirits have spoken and the §H[fallen_empire_warner.GetSpeciesAdj]§! people shall obey, for it is now war between our people and the unholy machines of the §H[Root.GetName]§!! We doubt the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] can feel fear, for they are but abominable facsimiles of life. The end of the §H[Root.GetName]§! is nigh!"

 zofe_awakening.200.desc:0 "Halt, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural].\n\nYour recent research and pitiful progress with Dark Matter Technologies have not gone unnoticed in the §H[fallen_empire_warner.GetAdj]§! society, as we have found evidence of misuse that warrant our utmost concern. The scientific progress of the §H[Root.GetName]§! had been unregulated for some time, and your reckless pursuit of dangerous technologies threaten not only our national security, but also galactic peace.\n\nThis must end now. Our overseers are on their way to take charge of your research institutes, to ensure future technological progress are obtained safely and ethically."

We would be all too happy to arrange a demonstration, and put [Root.GetAdj] ambitions to rest."
 zofe_awakening.202.desc.b:0 "Enough!\n\nYour reckless pursuit of science and your ambition to achieve technological parity with the §H[fallen_empire_warner.GetName]§! must be stopped. Since you will not accept our offers of regulation in peace, our overseers must now enter with our fleets. Young civilizations such as yours never learn."
 zofe_awakening.202.a:0 "We have no choice but to defend our scientific progress."

Naturally, anti-tinkering devices have been installed and many of its advanced components had been replaced with cruder, less sophisticated technology, so you are not overly confused by their operations.\n\nShould you succeed and defeat the zealots, it would prove most amusing indeed."
 zofe_awakening.205.a:0 "We accept your generous donation of hardware."

We assure you our volunteers are well trained and eager for battle."
