Many theories arise, with the possibility of a civil war, an ambush gone wrong, or even simple scrappers taking away any evidence regarding the existence of Party Omicron, but as the archeology team cracked deeper into the Escort's combat computer, these theories were silenced.\n\nParty Omicron was a distinct force, and fielded only a handful of vessels - no more than thirty, versus an array of vessels from Party Aleph. Potentially hundreds of vessels fought in this one, singular battle, and there is not yet a single shred of evidence that Party Omicron was present at all.\n\nWhat happened here?"

Party Omicron did not escape the battle unscathed, but the disparity between these forces explains full well why we have no traced of their presence - the raw amount of firepower the log details as required to destroy even one of Omicron's vessels meant that each kill was by saturation - whatever was left of the vessels once they were destroyed were simply atomized by the followup volley.\n\nNearly 80% of Omicron's forces were destroyed in this engagement, and Omicron's flagship engaged in a fighting retreat as it escaped. The failure to kill that flagship, what our translations can only parse as the Giant or the Goliath, was the undoing of this Escort. A stray energy beam crippled the vessel and it was left to drift, forgotten by its allies.\n\nWhat little linguistic data we can gather otherwise has been stored for further analysis, and our salvage teams are ready to begin dissecting the vessel in hopes of recovering something, anything, more from this relic."

Careful study of the weapon within its mounting reveals it to be some sort of Energy Torpedo Launcher, much like a Proton or Neutron Launcher, except this weapon utilized exotic Dark Energy as both the primary catalyst and warhead.\n\nThe science of it is utterly baffling to our [GetScientistPlural], but enough study has been conducted on the wreck to begin replicating it for controlled recreation and field tests.

The amount of debris here are relatively few and far between. Even after extensive sweeps, scanning patterns, and speculative trajectory calculations, we have only managed to find a handful of vessels from Party Aleph. This is in stunning contrast to the prior engagement, which led our [GetArchaeologistPlural] to speculate that this was perhaps an example of a successful, less attritional fleet engagement.\n\nWhatever the case, the largest vessel among the wrecks excavated thus far has served as our base of operations for data recovery and technological retrieval.

Thankfully the damage was precisely inflicted, and once circumvented, restoring the backup systems was only a matter of time. The vessel's data-logs have been accessed, and the findings are presented as follows.\n\nThis vessel of Party Aleph was part of a larger raiding operation covering this expanse of space some ten-thousand years ago, presumably against the planetary holdings of Party Omicron. The strike force was small and swift, with no more than a few dozen vessels between them all to engage in rapid hit-and-runs against colonial infrastructure.\n\nUnfortunately for Party Aleph, this raiding fleet appears to have been detected before they reached their destination, and were subsequently caught out of position. Diagnostic reports indicate that their FTL drives were subject to jamming by Party Omicron, forcing the raiders to flee at sublight speed. Pursuing with speed almost unbelievable to our [GetScientistPlural], it only took a few hours for the fleet to be found and destroyed. Party Omicron appeared to have suffered no damage in the process.\n\nTranslations into the captain's log are forthcoming, which we hope will prove more enlightening than the previous dig."

The Aleph empire, along with several others, took part in this grand rebellion.\n\nFrom the captain's own estimations, the war was not going well for either side - their raids seemed to have been probing attacks aimed to distract the various battle formations of Omicron, so pressure could be eased elsewhere.\n\nUsing the Battlecruiser and other pieces of wreck as reference, we have managed to excise one of the weapon systems from this once great vessel's arsenal - a Dark Energy Accelerator. Analogous to a conventional Plasma Accelerators or their primitive counterparts, this weapon somehow supplements the plasma-state of the warhead for an exotic Dark-Energy package, something that seemed impossible to modern sciences.

A single chunk of resplendent armor paneling, no more than the size of a small shuttle, torn from whatever vessel it belonged to in this confrontation.\n\nOur survey teams have already quarantined and taken the armor piece onboard for study, and our [GetArchaeologistPlural] have hastened their study of these myriad wrecks for clues as to where this piece came from.

A small Omicron fleet was intercepted in this system before they could join forces with a major fighting formation.\n\nThe fleet commander saw fit to exercise one of their most successful strategies against Party Omicron - an engagement at point blank proximity, denying the enemy their advantage of superior range. Timing the ambush down to the hour, the vessels of Party Aleph and their allies arrived in system as close to the hyperlane entry as they could, just as the reinforcement fleet arrived.\n\nSpread wide and thin, the asymmetric disposition of the coalition vessels was to their advantage, forcing the small number of Omicron vessels into grueling engagements with each intercepting fleet as it arrived into range. An incredibly costly maneuver, that nonetheless appeared to work. The reinforcement fleet of Party Omicron retreated some hours into the battle, despite the casualties sustained by the ambushers.\n\nThe flagship of the coalition fleet succumbed to its damage hours later, but the crew considered their mission fulfilled."

Comparing the intact wrecks we have found to previous examples, we now have greater insights into their construction processes.\n\nWhere we once assumed that vessels from Party Aleph were simply outfitted with superior technology, comparative analysis shows that we overlooked key structural differences, buried either by battle damage or our own ignorance. The keels of these vessels are laid down in a more compact, durable, and ultimately spacious design - allowing for many pockets of space once occupied by armor to be filled by a variety of components, or simply reinforced further. The ideal weapons loadout invariably increases as a result, and these modifications are not entirely impossible to replicate in existing ships.\n\nOur engineering division suggests development on the project as soon as possible, so that we might exploit these designs to further bolster our empire."

The presence of several larger vessels among the wrecks lends credence to this being a major fleet that was engaged and destroyed.\n\nThere is something noteworthy however, and that is the presence of vessels from Party Omicron. Two vessels, resembling a contemporary Battlecruiser and Escort, have been found in various states of disrepair. The Battlecruiser has had its central reactor core detonated, with the blast suggesting that it was the result of several concentrated Titan Lance shots. The Escort, which had its engines destroyed and hull vented, suffered a slower death from smaller weapons-fire until it was rendered nonfunctional.\n\nWhile there are surviving examples of Party Aleph's vessels, our team is understandably more focused on the Escort and Battlecruiser, and are conducting a delicate sweep for data and technology."

What could be extracted was junk data, linguistics, personal logs, and navigational data - this material proved far easier to translate and digest than expected, the language spoken by Party Omicron appeared to be well integrated into our algorithms for Party Aleph. Nevertheless, we've managed to combine the strategic information from Party Aleph's salvage data and cross-referenced it with the translations of the Battlecruiser.\n\nThese Omicron vessels belonged to a fighting formation known as a Battle Group, one translated as simply 'North', which was responsible for the defense of an entire quarter of Omicron's territory ten thousand years ago. This fleet apparently engaged in a punitive campaign against Party Aleph, whom they simply referred to as 'Traitors', after being rotated from an 'ongoing defensive action' along the galactic rim. This engagement represented a significant portion of both Party Aleph and Battle Group North's forces.\n\nThe teams are still working on compiling and translating further data, while our salvage teams occupy themselves with attempting to find some measure of worth from Party Aleph's wrecks - the initial assessment on the architecture of the two Party Omicron vessels proved to be otherwise unpromising for reverse-engineering."

Despite often complained about the deteriorating punctuality of his reinforcements, §HAdmiral Armageddon§! was all too eager to inflict upon the Aleph forces a crushing defeat rather than splitting his forces and squashing minor fleets in a long, tedious campaign.\n\nThough a victory for §HBattle Group North§!, it did not go entirely as planned. The two vessels destroyed here suffered from coordinated, simultaneous Titan Lance blows before they could even hope to disengage, showing true fire discipline in the face of insurmountable odds. Though the targeting computers do not appear to be any different from those utilized by Fallen Empires or ourselves, the sensor suites of Party Aleph's vessels are of some note - Dark-Energy based, as Party Aleph clearly displays mastery over this principle, which enabled them to divine the force composition of Battle Group North's forces several jumps ahead of time."

Theories abound of another joint operation - or more radically, an interrupted skirmish between assumed allies, but our team will need time to investigate.\n\nWreckage from Party Omicron is, for the quality of the vessels aligned against them, expectedly low. We have only identified the warped hulk of a single Battlecruiser, alongside two destroyed escorts flanking it - subject to precise damage against their subsystems.

With the bulk of Omicron fleets seemingly occupied in the outer rim, smaller patrol fleets of Party Omicron roamed freely - a battlecruiser and three escorts alone posed an oppressive threat to uncoordinated patrols, as did this quartet of vessels roaming Kaph Space.\n\nWith this context, the wreckage present seems far more generous than we could have initially predicted.

With support from Party Aleph, the Kaph entity warfleet was in a far better position to engage - and they did so with zeal. Emboldened by the presence of their allies, the Kaph fleets engaged in a brutal melee with the Omicron vessels, soaking up shots to allow the vessels of Party Aleph to engage from a distance, forcing one escort into an emergency FTL jump, and the other three rendered ineffective and spaced.\n\nIt was of particular note that many of the casualties sustained by the Kaph entities were inflicted by strike-craft gun-runs, and our archeologists estimate more would have been present, if not for the defensive aegis provided by Aleph's escorts. One of these subsystems has been successfully extracted by our salvage teams, and unsurprisingly, it is a Dark-Energy based design.

Even ruined as it is, the bulk of its hull retains its imposing figure, and we can only consider with dread that we may only be seeing a part of this vessel, and not its original whole.\n\nThe survey crews and salvage teams moved in the shadow of that leviathan in almost reverent awe as they conducted their work, searching for an access-point that connected to the vessel's superstructure. The sheer size of this ship precludes a thorough search, so our team has been forced to adopt pragmatic sensor-sweeps of its bulk, searching for compartments representing control hubs, maintenance centers, weapons batteries.

From there it was simply a matter of reactivating localized power, securing a proper transit route for the followup team, and making sure the vessel was devoid of any nasty surprises or failsafes left behind by the crew for any boarders.\n\nThere have only been a few minor hiccups so far along the way. The lack of fully intact atmospheric controls has left some pressure zones that posed a minor hazard, and the ship has been attempting to draw power from our localized generators to restore primary functions - leading to a few close-calls with overloading power supplies before they figured out how to isolate the conduits.

The vessel itself almost seems to defy our expectations, the ease with which long dormant systems came back to life under our repair gave us a wealth of engineering data. Our [GetEngineerPlural] suggest we seek out an active maintenance center in the hopes that we recover localized schematics, or perhaps even a blueprint of the vessel itself.\n\nThe few functional terminals we have accessed so far have mostly been detailing reports from lower class ratings operating in these sections. Their reports detailed a major victory against Party Omicron, specifically against §HBattle Group North§!. Their success evidently saw the vessel engaging in further battles against Omicron vessels moving to reinforce the doomed fleet, and the ship was running low on supplies in this campaign.\n\nSometime prior to this vessel's destruction, supply ships ceased coming, with the last resupply carrying a message from the homeworlds.

A poetic label, as this vessel was intended to be a psychological symbol of defiance against Party Omicron, and the lynchpin behind many of their offensive engagements. Second among this information was the presence of the builder's annotations in the schematics - apparently the construction of this vessel was so time consuming and laborious that they had eventually come to further optimize their work mid-construction. As such, this vessel appears to hold a complete blueprint of its construction specifications.\n\nWhile not located in this particular data-stack, it has still thrown our team into a frenzy to locate it.

The room was removed from the worst of the damage and decay the ship had sustained, but yet internal inconsistencies lead us to believe the command suite was occupied for some time after the vessel's destruction.

By the Supreme Commander's reckoning, Omicron had completely called off all operational fronts in response to their victory, and gathered the three major Battle Groups that remained - Battle Groups South, East, and West, and launched a devastating campaign into Party Aleph's core systems.\n\nVessels that managed to escape and regroup with §YThe Emissary§! report that ground battles were never fought - Omicron simply bombard their worlds from orbit, removing all traces of resistance in their path. In the face of overwhelming odds, what little remained of Party Aleph's navy fought a determined, yet futile guerilla war. As for §YThe Emissary§!, it rallied what survivors it could to its banner, and made one last, desperate stand against their enemy.\n\nThe battle was a slaughter, and Party Aleph's last remaining naval force fought and died in this system, far from their destroyed homes and now dead people.

On his sick bed, '§HDoctor Divine§!' created his last weapon, the Portal Generator, to bring his 'love' from the other side.
